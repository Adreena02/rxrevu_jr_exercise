Exercise
    The exercise is part of a cell based simulation. The simulation is given a 3x3 grid with specific cells active. Count the number of active neighbors around a given cell. 
    Count the number of active neighbors around a given cell.

    Every cells has eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

    Write a program that counts the number of active cells around the center cell (labeled 'cell').

Bonus Exercise
    Modify the program created above so that it can count the number of active cells around the center cell *OR* count the number of active around the top left cell (labeled '1'). IOW, given a specific cell, count the number of active cells around it.
